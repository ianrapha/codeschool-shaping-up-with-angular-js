# Synopsis
Code of the app created in Codeschool course Shaping Up With AngularJS.

# Changes
* Using application.css to change form field colors
* CSS and JS moved from root to directories (js and css)

# Run
You will need to serve your code from a webserver and access it on localhost. 
I used [http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server) and default port is 8080.

npm install http-server -g

http-server /path/to/app
